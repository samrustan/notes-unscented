1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:05,120
The model we use so far assumes
objects always keep going straight.

2
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:09,590
The model we will use from now on
assumes objects can move straight, but

3
00:00:09,590 --> 00:00:13,910
they can also move with a constant turn
rate and a constant velocity magnitude.

4
00:00:13,910 --> 00:00:17,030
This model is often
called the CTRV model.

5
00:00:17,030 --> 00:00:18,814
Let's have a look at the state
vector we are going to use.

6
00:00:18,814 --> 00:00:23,431
We keep calling the two-dimensional
position of the bike px and py,

7
00:00:23,431 --> 00:00:26,070
where p stands for position.

8
00:00:26,070 --> 00:00:30,890
But instead of describing the velocity
with vx and vy, we use the speed and

9
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:32,320
yaw angle.

10
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:35,995
The speed is the magnitude of
the velocity, which we'll call v.

11
00:00:35,995 --> 00:00:40,940
And the yaw angle is the orientation,
which we'll call psi.

12
00:00:40,940 --> 00:00:44,590
Since we also want to be able to
estimate the yaw rate psi dot,

13
00:00:44,590 --> 00:00:46,740
we add it to the state vector too.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:49,600
Constant yaw rate and
constant speed is a good model for

15
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,260
vehicle behavior in
real traffic scenarios.

16
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:53,510
Let's try to get a feeling for that.
