1
00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:04,919
You have successfully predicted
the state mean and covariance matrix.

2
00:00:04,919 --> 00:00:09,980
Terrific, this means we can go
into the update step now and

3
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:11,240
predict the measurement.

4
00:00:12,289 --> 00:00:14,009
This is where we are now.

5
00:00:14,009 --> 00:00:17,079
We have successfully predicted
the state from times step k

6
00:00:17,079 --> 00:00:19,359
to times k step plus one.

7
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:22,869
Now we have to transform the predicted
state into the measurement space.

8
00:00:23,910 --> 00:00:28,149
The function that defines this
transformation is the measurement model.

9
00:00:28,149 --> 00:00:32,250
Of course, now we have to consider what
kind of sensor produced the current

10
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:35,530
measurement and
use the corresponding measurement model.

11
00:00:35,530 --> 00:00:38,079
The problem we have here is very similar

12
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:40,729
to the problem we had
in the prediction step.

13
00:00:40,729 --> 00:00:46,149
We need to transform a distribution
through a non linear function so

14
00:00:46,149 --> 00:00:49,539
we can apply exactly the same on
center transformation approach

15
00:00:49,539 --> 00:00:52,679
as we did before during
the state prediction.

16
00:00:52,679 --> 00:00:57,509
However, we can take two shortcuts
here and make it a little easier.

17
00:00:57,509 --> 00:00:58,820
Let me show you how.

18
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:03,480
The first thing we did in the prediction
step was generating [INAUDIBLE] points.

19
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:07,090
We could do the same here again
using the predicted mean and

20
00:01:07,090 --> 00:01:08,100
covariance matrix.

21
00:01:09,109 --> 00:01:11,829
However, a popular shortcut is

22
00:01:11,829 --> 00:01:17,049
to just reuse the signal points we
already have from the prediction step.

23
00:01:17,049 --> 00:01:20,250
So we can skip generating
sigma points this time.

24
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:23,909
In this very case,
we can also skip the augmentation step.

25
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:25,189
Why is that?

26
00:01:25,189 --> 00:01:28,009
We needed the augmentation
because the process noise

27
00:01:28,010 --> 00:01:30,690
had a non linear effect on the state.

28
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:34,420
Let's assume we're talking about
a greater measurement in this example.

29
00:01:34,420 --> 00:01:37,890
Here the measurement model was
a non linear fraction, but

30
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:41,840
the measurement noise had
a purely additive effect.

31
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,090
In this case we don't need
to perform an augmentation,

32
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:48,299
there is an easier way to
consider the measurement noise.

33
00:01:48,299 --> 00:01:50,179
I will show you later how this works.

34
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,579
So the only thing that's left for
us to do is actually transforming

35
00:01:54,579 --> 00:01:59,569
the individual sigma points we already
have into the measurement space and

36
00:01:59,569 --> 00:02:02,579
using them to calculate the mean and

37
00:02:02,579 --> 00:02:06,310
the covariance matrix S of
the predicted measurement.

38
00:02:06,310 --> 00:02:09,960
Again, we want to store the transformed
measurement signal points

39
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,159
as columns in a matrix.

40
00:02:12,159 --> 00:02:15,060
I call this matrix colorgraphic Z.

41
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:17,590
Remember the measurement
space of the rater.

42
00:02:17,590 --> 00:02:20,650
This was the radial distance rho,
the angle phi, and

43
00:02:20,650 --> 00:02:26,050
the radial velocity rho dot, so
it is a three dimensional space.

44
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,580
This means the matrix with the
measurement sigma points has three rows

45
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:32,170
and 15 columns in our case.

46
00:02:32,169 --> 00:02:34,250
Regarding for
the measurement noise omega,

47
00:02:34,250 --> 00:02:38,569
just put in 0 here, since we will
account for the measurement noise later.

48
00:02:38,569 --> 00:02:42,049
Now that we have the sigma points and
the measurement space, We want to

49
00:02:42,050 --> 00:02:46,550
calculate the resulting mean and
covariance of the predicted measurement.

50
00:02:46,550 --> 00:02:50,030
This is also very similar as before and
given by these equations.

51
00:02:51,080 --> 00:02:53,670
The only thing that comes
in addition here is that we

52
00:02:53,669 --> 00:02:56,149
add the measurement covariance noise.

53
00:02:56,150 --> 00:02:59,020
This is how we account for
the measurement noise.

54
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:02,439
Remember, we can do this instead
of the augmentation here,

55
00:03:02,439 --> 00:03:05,490
because the measurement noise
in our case does not have

56
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,530
a non-linear effect on the measurement
but it's purely additive.

57
00:03:09,800 --> 00:03:13,150
And that's how you predict
the measurement mean and covariance.

58
00:03:13,150 --> 00:03:15,969
It's exactly the same
problem set as before, but

59
00:03:15,969 --> 00:03:20,400
by using the two sharp cards I just
introduced, it is a very easy step.

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,129
After this step you have made it almost
through the UKF processing chain.
