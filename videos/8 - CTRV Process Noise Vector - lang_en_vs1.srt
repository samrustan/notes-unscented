00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,780
What we have introduced so far was the
deterministic part of the process model.

2
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:11,020
But of course, we also need to consider
the stochastic part of the process model

3
00:00:11,020 --> 00:00:15,070
and that has something to do
with the process noise new k.

4
00:00:15,070 --> 00:00:20,450
We will describe the uncertainty of
the process model with a two-dimensional

5
00:00:20,450 --> 00:00:25,320
noise vector new k, consisting of two
independent scalar noise processes.

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,910
The first noise process is the
longitudinal acceleration noise new a.

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:33,230
It influences the longitudinal
speed of the vehicle and

8
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:36,970
it randomly changes its
value at every time step k.

9
00:00:36,970 --> 00:00:41,550
The longitudinal acceleration
is a normally distributed white

10
00:00:41,550 --> 00:00:47,320
noise with zero mean and
the variance sigma a squared.

11
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:51,540
The other noise process is the yaw
acceleration new site dot dot.

12
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:56,808
It is also a normal distributed
white noise with zero mean and

13
00:00:56,808 --> 00:01:00,851
it has the variance sigma
yaw dot dot squared.

14
00:01:00,851 --> 00:01:05,765
And what I want to discuss with you
next is how the noise vector new

15
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:08,320
k influences our process model.
