1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:04,470
So, you already solved the last
three rows, that's great.

2
00:00:04,470 --> 00:00:08,130
For the first two rows,
we actually have to solve the integral.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:10,430
There is no way around this time.

4
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:15,440
First, let's insert the assumption
that the velocity v is a constant.

5
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,779
So we can move the velocity at time
K as a constant before the integral.

6
00:00:20,779 --> 00:00:25,974
Also, we can explicitly express sin
as a function of T using again,

7
00:00:25,974 --> 00:00:28,994
the assumption of a constant yar rate.

8
00:00:28,994 --> 00:00:31,881
After the video,
take a moment to look at this term and

9
00:00:31,881 --> 00:00:34,840
try to figure out what's going on here?

10
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,850
For the first two rows we now
have an explicit function of t.

11
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:41,060
All other variables are constants.

12
00:00:41,060 --> 00:00:44,500
So now it is possible to
solve these integrals.

13
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,530
You can look up the solution of
these integrals in a text book or

14
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:50,150
you can solve them with an online tool.

15
00:00:50,150 --> 00:00:52,630
You will find a link below the video.

16
00:00:52,630 --> 00:00:54,710
Consider this a bonus question for

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,620
those who are really good
in solving Integrals.

18
00:00:57,620 --> 00:01:01,120
I don't really expect you to
solve this Integral on the fly.

19
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,750
Unless of course you think you can.
