00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:04,920
Congratulations, combining LIDAR and
RADAR measurements with the help of

2
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,000
extended and unsended comment
filters is incredibly impressive.

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,140
These are core skills that we use on
the Sensor Fusion team at Mercedes-Benz.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:18,920
&gt;&gt; Let's think about where Sensor Fusion
fits into the entire autonomous vehicle

5
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,620
technology stack.

6
00:00:20,620 --> 00:00:25,311
First, sensors record the data, then
there are pre-processing steps such as

7
00:00:25,311 --> 00:00:30,240
clustering algorithms, or more complex
solutions to detect object hypothesis.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,490
And finally, we can use these hypothesis
as input for object level fusion.

9
00:00:35,580 --> 00:00:37,170
&gt;&gt; Inside the sensor fusion block,

10
00:00:37,170 --> 00:00:40,980
we combined that data together
like you did in this lesson.

11
00:00:40,980 --> 00:00:43,270
And this is not the only possible flow,

12
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:47,660
we can apply sensor fusion at
each of these processing steps.

13
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:51,820
&gt;&gt; Once we have the more consistent
representation of the surrounding world,

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:56,670
we pass the results to other part of
the autonomous vehicle system Further

15
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:01,250
down the line, different teams will
use this data to localize the vehicle,

16
00:01:01,250 --> 00:01:04,920
control the vehicle, and
plan the vehicle's path.

17
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:08,300
&gt;&gt; It's also worth thinking about ways
in which the world is more complicated

18
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,360
that what we've discussed so far.

19
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,060
For example, in this lesson,

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:15,030
we have assumed there is
only one object to track.

21
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,680
But what if there are many
cars on the street?

22
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:21,210
Then you have to find out which
measurement belongs to which vehicle,

23
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,300
that makes sensor fusion even harder.

24
00:01:23,300 --> 00:01:26,710
&gt;&gt; But the core techniques you have
learned in this lesson are the key to

25
00:01:26,710 --> 00:01:31,430
extended the sensor fusion block to
handle these more complicated scenarios.

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:35,110
&gt;&gt; Sensor fusion is a critical part
of an autonomous driving system and

27
00:01:35,110 --> 00:01:37,910
the other parts of the system
rely on this data.

28
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:42,040
&gt;&gt; In future modules, you will learn
about how the components of this system

29
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:45,690
used fused sensor data to
complete their functions.

30
00:01:45,690 --> 00:01:47,530
Good luck on the final
sensor fusion project.
