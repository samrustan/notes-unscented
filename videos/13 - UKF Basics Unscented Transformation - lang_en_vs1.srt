00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:04,270
The end center transformation solves
this problem using sigma points.

2
00:00:04,270 --> 00:00:06,710
What are these sigma points,
and how do they help us?

3
00:00:07,770 --> 00:00:11,410
It can be difficult to transform
the whole state distribution through

4
00:00:11,410 --> 00:00:13,360
a nonlinear function.

5
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,620
But it is very easy to transform
individual points of the state space

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:22,480
through the non-linear function, and
this is what sigma points are for.

7
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,570
The sigma points are chosen around the
mean state and in a certain relation to

8
00:00:26,570 --> 00:00:30,510
the standard deviation signal
of every state dimension.

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:33,650
This is why these points
are called sigma points.

10
00:00:33,650 --> 00:00:37,440
This serve as representatives
of the whole distribution.

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,850
Once you have chosen the sigma points,

12
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:44,230
you just insert every single sigma
point into the non and your function f.

13
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,620
So they will come out somewhere
here in the predictive state space.

14
00:00:50,620 --> 00:00:53,640
All you have to do now is
calculate the mean and

15
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,880
the covariance of your
group of sigma points.

16
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,460
This will now provide the same mean and

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:02,840
covariance as the real
predicted distribution.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:06,840
But in many cases,
it gives a useful approximation.

19
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,080
By the way, you can apply the same
technique in the linear case.

20
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:15,480
In this case, you will even find
the exact solution of the sigma points.

21
00:01:15,480 --> 00:01:19,320
So if the process more or
less linear, the sigma point approach

22
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,830
provides exactly the same solution
as the standard common feature.

23
00:01:23,830 --> 00:01:26,780
But you would not use
sigma points here because

24
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:29,170
they are more expensive in
terms of calculation time.

25
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,170
So let's wrap this up.

26
00:01:32,170 --> 00:01:35,610
This is what you really have because
of your non linear process model.

27
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:40,905
This is the best possible mean and
covariance you could use

28
00:01:40,905 --> 00:01:44,735
if you want to keep pretending
you have a normal distribution.

29
00:01:44,735 --> 00:01:47,735
And this is what the sigma
points give you.

30
00:01:47,735 --> 00:01:50,635
Now you know the general idea
of an unscented transformation.

31
00:01:50,635 --> 00:01:53,215
Time to get started with
the unscented comment filter.
