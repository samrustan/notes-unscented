00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,600
Okay, let's put
the augmentation into C++ code.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,860
Now the dimension of
the augmented state is 7.

3
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:09,600
Other things you will need
are the variance of the longitudinal

4
00:00:09,600 --> 00:00:12,710
acceleration and the yaw acceleration.

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:16,590
Together, they build the process noise
covariance matrix which we call Q.

6
00:00:17,780 --> 00:00:20,790
The rest is almost the same
as in the last person.

7
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:25,430
But this time, you have to build
the augmented state mean x_aug, and

8
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:28,410
the augmented covariance matrix P_aug.

9
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:32,350
Again, have a look at the cheat sheet,
it will also help you here.

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:35,014
When you build the augmented mean state,

11
00:00:35,014 --> 00:00:39,600
consider that the mean value of
the acceleration noises are both zero.

12
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,470
And this is where
the augmented sigma points go.

13
00:00:42,470 --> 00:00:45,230
Pay attention to
the dimensions of this matrix.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:46,180
Good luck with the quiz.
