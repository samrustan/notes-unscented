00:00:00,470 --> 00:00:03,870
Welcome to the last coding
quiz before the project.

2
00:00:03,870 --> 00:00:07,378
We want to calculate this time
is the UpdatedState X and

3
00:00:07,378 --> 00:00:10,530
the UpdatedCovariance matrix P.

4
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:13,850
We need a lot of
pre-calculated data this time.

5
00:00:13,850 --> 00:00:17,160
These are the predicted sigma
points in the state space.

6
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,890
This is the predicted state mean and
the state prediction covariance.

7
00:00:21,890 --> 00:00:24,920
You can use this variable x again, and

8
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:27,520
override it later with
the updated state.

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:28,550
The same is true for

10
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:33,110
the variable p, override this one
with the updated covariance matrix.

11
00:00:34,310 --> 00:00:37,269
Here we have the predicted sigma
points in the measurement space.

12
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:41,720
This is the predicted
measurement mean and

13
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,110
this is the covariance of
the measurement prediction.

14
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:48,530
And of course, you need some values for
the actual measurement z.

15
00:00:49,720 --> 00:00:52,225
Here you can store your
intermediate results for

16
00:00:52,225 --> 00:00:53,985
the cross correlation matrix t.

17
00:00:55,625 --> 00:01:00,445
Again, make sure to use the variable
x and the variable P to store your

18
00:01:00,445 --> 00:01:03,925
updated state and
your updated covariance matrix.

19
00:01:03,925 --> 00:01:06,625
All right,
good luck with this final coding quiz.
