00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:04,900
In the last lesson we used a process
model with constant velocity.

2
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,100
However, with the assumption that the
velocity is constant you're simplifying

3
00:00:09,100 --> 00:00:13,140
the way vehicles actually moves
because most roads has turns.

4
00:00:13,140 --> 00:00:16,262
But this is the problem because
a process model with assumption of

5
00:00:16,262 --> 00:00:20,980
constant velocity and direction will
predict turning vehicles incorrectly.

6
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,740
In the next quiz, think about
how assuming constant velocity

7
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:27,250
might effect the prediction for
a vehicle that is turning.
