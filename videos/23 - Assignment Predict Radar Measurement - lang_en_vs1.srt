00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,200
The goal of this coding quiz
is to predict the mean and

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:06,700
the covariance of a radar measurement.

3
00:00:06,700 --> 00:00:12,170
We expect a radar measurement, so I set
the measurement dimension to three here.

4
00:00:12,170 --> 00:00:14,340
This is an example how
I set the weights.

5
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:19,010
To be able to build the measurement
covariance matrix r,

6
00:00:19,010 --> 00:00:21,900
you need the values for
the radar measurement uncertainty.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:26,700
And of course,
you need the predicted sigma points.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,950
This is the matrix, where you can
store your measurement sigma points.

9
00:00:30,950 --> 00:00:33,700
And these are the two output objects,

10
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:39,030
the predicted measurement mean, and
the predicted covariance matrix, s.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:39,930
Good luck with the quiz.
