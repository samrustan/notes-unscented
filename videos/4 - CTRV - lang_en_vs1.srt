1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:03,500
Now, let's take a look at how
the assumption of a circular motion

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:05,190
leads to a process model.

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:08,270
So in this example,
at time k, the car's here.

4
00:00:08,270 --> 00:00:13,935
The goal of the process model f is to
predict where the car is at time k + 1.

5
00:00:13,935 --> 00:00:16,531
Written as an equation,
it looks like this.

6
00:00:16,531 --> 00:00:20,960
The process model f predicts
the state at time step k + 1.

7
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:23,020
Given the state at time step k and

8
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:27,330
a noise vector new k,
this is the function we want to find.

9
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:30,420
What we want to do now is
derive this process model.

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:34,010
I will show you a very general and,
therefore, powerful approach.

11
00:00:34,010 --> 00:00:37,770
You will be able to use this approach
to derive process models for

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:40,650
many, many real world problems.

13
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:44,290
We cannot directly write down the
process model simply by looking at this

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:45,250
figure.

15
00:00:45,250 --> 00:00:48,980
But we can say something about
the change rate of the state x,

16
00:00:48,980 --> 00:00:50,130
called x dot.

17
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:52,950
From the geometric relations,

18
00:00:52,950 --> 00:00:59,370
we can directly derive how the change
rate x dot depends on the state x.

19
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,650
This is a differential equation.

20
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:05,650
What I would like you to do now is
derive this differential equation.

21
00:01:05,650 --> 00:01:09,375
The goal is to express each of
the five-time relatives of the state,

22
00:01:09,375 --> 00:01:12,530
independency of any of
the state elements.

23
00:01:12,530 --> 00:01:18,710
I'll show you an example, Px dot is
the same as the velocity in x direction.

24
00:01:18,710 --> 00:01:21,560
Unfortunately, the velocity
in x direction

25
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,450
is not part of the state vector,
otherwise, I would be finished already.

26
00:01:26,450 --> 00:01:30,220
But the speed V and the origin of psi
are both elements of the state vector.

27
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:34,610
And if I look at this triangle,

28
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:39,217
I can identify that Vx
= cosine psi times V.

29
00:01:39,217 --> 00:01:42,410
Now, go ahead and
pick the correct terms for

30
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,220
the four remaining change
rates of the state.
