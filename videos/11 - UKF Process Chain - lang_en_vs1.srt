00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:03,980
What you have derived for
the CTR remodel, is a process model that

2
00:00:03,980 --> 00:00:08,500
considers the possibility to drive
on a straight line, or doing a turn.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,770
That's really great because it will
help us to achieve good results

4
00:00:11,770 --> 00:00:13,400
when tracking a bike
in the project later.

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,271
Now let's go to the next part of this
lesson, and see how the UKF works.

6
00:00:17,271 --> 00:00:21,341
The way the incentive common filter
processes measurements over time is

7
00:00:21,341 --> 00:00:25,210
exactly the same as the extended
common filter does.

8
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,740
We have a prediction step, which is
independent of the measurement model.

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:31,350
In this step, you will use
the CTR model we just arrived.

10
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,215
Then we have an update step where we
use the radar measurement model, or

11
00:00:35,215 --> 00:00:36,406
the laser measurement model,

12
00:00:36,406 --> 00:00:38,584
depending on the type of
measurement we just received.

13
00:00:38,584 --> 00:00:43,199
This means you'll be able to apply
the same top level processing chain for

14
00:00:43,199 --> 00:00:48,590
the incentive common filter as you
use for the extended common filter.

15
00:00:48,590 --> 00:00:52,155
The difference between the incentive and
the extended common filters is how

16
00:00:52,155 --> 00:00:55,496
the incentive common filter deals
with the non linear process models or

17
00:00:55,496 --> 00:00:56,572
measurement models.

18
00:00:56,572 --> 00:01:00,269
For that, the incentive common filter
uses an approach called incentive

19
00:01:00,269 --> 00:01:01,238
transformation.

20
00:01:01,238 --> 00:01:02,680
Let me show what this is.
