1
00:00:00,710 --> 00:00:04,380
In this quiz, we have two
objects we want to calculate.

2
00:00:04,380 --> 00:00:08,170
The mean predicted state X and
the state prediction covariance P.

3
00:00:09,340 --> 00:00:13,420
This time we started the point but we
already have the predicted sigma points.

4
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,390
This is a vector where you can put
them the weights for the sigma points.

5
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:21,620
This is the vector for
the predicted state mean and

6
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:24,960
this is the metrics for
the state prediction conversions.

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:25,910
Good luck with this quiz.
