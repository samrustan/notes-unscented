00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:03,710
How does the noise vector affect
the overall process model?

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,090
Let's do this again row for row starting
from the bottom with the yaw rate.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:14,655
Assuming the yaw
acceleration new sin delta

4
00:00:14,655 --> 00:00:18,565
is constant between k and k plus one.

5
00:00:18,565 --> 00:00:22,275
It will just linearly add up to
the yaw rate with increasing time.

6
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,605
So,the influence of the yaw
acceleration on the yaw rate

7
00:00:27,605 --> 00:00:30,265
is the yaw acceleration times delta t.

8
00:00:31,455 --> 00:00:35,729
Can you calculate the influence of
the noise processes as new a and

9
00:00:35,729 --> 00:00:38,846
new sin delta on the yaw angle and
the velocity.

10
00:00:38,846 --> 00:00:42,192
Consider that the longitudinal
acceleration, u,

11
00:00:42,192 --> 00:00:45,543
a is also constant constant
between k and k plus one.
