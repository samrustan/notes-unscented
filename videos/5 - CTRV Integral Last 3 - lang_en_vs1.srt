00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:03,856
We have the complete differential
equation now, awesome.

2
00:00:03,856 --> 00:00:07,090
But how do we get from time
step k to time step k+1?

3
00:00:07,090 --> 00:00:13,930
Let's say the discrete time step k
relates to the continuous time value tk,

4
00:00:13,930 --> 00:00:19,334
and the discrete time step k+1 relates
to the continuous time value tk + 1.

5
00:00:19,334 --> 00:00:24,720
The difference between tk +1 and
tk is called Delta t.

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,960
Then this date at time k + 1
is given by the state of time

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,370
k + the integral over x.,
from time tk to time tk + 1.

8
00:00:36,370 --> 00:00:39,440
This can potentially be
a very complex calculation.

9
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,160
But in the special case of the CTRB,

10
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,570
this integral can be
solved pretty easily.

11
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:48,060
In the first two rows, I will just
insert the terms of the differential

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:51,790
equation without solving the integral,
we will do this later.

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:55,240
Let's start with the last three
rows which are the easiest.

14
00:00:55,240 --> 00:00:58,180
Even if you don't really remember
how to solve an integral,

15
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:02,050
you still might be able to choose
the correct answer in the quiz below.

16
00:01:02,050 --> 00:01:05,780
Remember we assume the weight and
velocity are constant.
