1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,430
Now, let's look at the influence of
the noise vector on the position.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:07,490
For this, I will zoom in to our object.

3
00:00:07,490 --> 00:00:10,990
This is where our object
is at time step k, and

4
00:00:10,990 --> 00:00:17,660
this is where our object is at time step
k+1, without any acceleration noise.

5
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:21,700
Clearly the yaw acceleration
noise will change the radius of

6
00:00:21,700 --> 00:00:22,910
the circle we are driving.

7
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:27,720
So the yaw acceleration does have
some influence onto the position.

8
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:32,880
If the yaw acceleration is positive,
we might end up here.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,870
And if the yaw acceleration is negative,
we might end up here.

10
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:40,560
However, we assume the effect
of the yaw acceleration on

11
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:44,910
the position is relatively small
in comparison to other factors.

12
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,360
And we will neglect here.

13
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:50,950
Now let's look at the effect of
the longitudinal acceleration noise

14
00:00:50,950 --> 00:00:52,600
on the position.

15
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,210
The exact calculation is
pretty straightforward.

16
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:58,580
You have to go back to the differential
equation where we started.

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:02,390
But this time instead of a constant
velocity, you would need to

18
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:07,300
assume a constant acceleration and
then solve the integral for that case.

19
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:10,800
This is absolutely doable, and
you are welcome to give it a try.

20
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:13,030
But it takes some time.

21
00:01:13,030 --> 00:01:15,220
I want to speed things up a little bit,
so

22
00:01:15,220 --> 00:01:18,340
we can go into the unscented
Kalman filter sooner.

23
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:22,620
So I suggest using an approximation
here, which is really easy, but

24
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:25,630
it's still pretty close
to the exact solution.

25
00:01:25,630 --> 00:01:30,830
What we will use as an approximation
is the acceleration offset of a car

26
00:01:30,830 --> 00:01:33,250
driving exactly straight, like here.

27
00:01:34,260 --> 00:01:38,950
This approximation will be okay as
long as the yaw rate is not too high.

28
00:01:40,260 --> 00:01:45,430
Can you tell me in the next quiz,
what the acceleration offset in Px and

29
00:01:45,430 --> 00:01:49,360
Py would be if the car
drove perfectly straight?
