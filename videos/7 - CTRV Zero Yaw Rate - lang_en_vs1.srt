1
00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:03,190
Now we have the solution
of the integral.

2
00:00:03,190 --> 00:00:07,822
It is a function that brings
the state from time step k,

3
00:00:07,822 --> 00:00:10,460
to time step k + 1, awesome.

4
00:00:10,460 --> 00:00:13,090
There's only one problem
with our solution and

5
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:16,820
that is the division by 0
when the yaw rate is in.

6
00:00:16,820 --> 00:00:19,460
And this is an important
case because it means

7
00:00:19,460 --> 00:00:23,640
the weakness driving on a straight road,
which happens quite often.

8
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,110
There are two ways to derive
the solution for this special case.

9
00:00:27,110 --> 00:00:30,110
You can put the yaw rate to 0
right from the beginning and

10
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:33,190
solve the integral again,
for this special case.

11
00:00:33,190 --> 00:00:35,520
But remember, when the yaw rate is 0,

12
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,400
it means the weaker drives
in a straight line.

13
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:40,420
In this case,

14
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:45,840
you can also directly see the solution
by looking at the triangle again.

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:49,600
In the next quiz, try to identify
the correct process model for

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,032
the special case when the yaw rate is 0.
