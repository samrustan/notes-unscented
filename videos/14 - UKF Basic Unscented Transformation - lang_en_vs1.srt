1
00:00:00,111 --> 00:00:03,919
What we will do in the remaining part of
this lesson is go through the processing

2
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:06,414
chain of the unscented
Kalman filter step by step.

3
00:00:06,414 --> 00:00:09,956
We will start with an example state
vector x and covariance matrix p and

4
00:00:09,956 --> 00:00:11,818
go all the way through prediction and

5
00:00:11,818 --> 00:00:15,616
measurement step until we reach
the updated state and covariance matrix.

6
00:00:15,616 --> 00:00:18,951
For every step, you will implement
a C++ function right away.

7
00:00:18,951 --> 00:00:21,947
So you will be well prepared for
the project in the end.

8
00:00:21,947 --> 00:00:25,320
As always, we will of course
start with the prediction step.

9
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,608
As you've seen before, we can split the
unscented prediction into three parts.

10
00:00:29,608 --> 00:00:33,153
First, we need to know a good
way to choose sigma points.

11
00:00:33,153 --> 00:00:36,448
Second, we need to know how
to predict the sigma points.

12
00:00:36,448 --> 00:00:39,582
Well, that's easy, just insert
them into the process function.

13
00:00:39,582 --> 00:00:43,465
And third, you need to know how to
calculate the prediction, mean, and

14
00:00:43,465 --> 00:00:45,958
covariance from
the predicted sigma points.

15
00:00:45,958 --> 00:00:47,437
Let's start with the first step.

16
00:00:47,437 --> 00:00:49,110
How do we choose the sigma points?
